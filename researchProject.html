        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>After the user research , I realized the potential a website's animations can be and how useful they are to the users.  Despite I have some animations, compare to the other websties I have seen in the competitor analysis portion mines can't come close.  I have notice certain improvements I could have used which could be vastly beneficial to the user, like a universal way to go back to the homepage regardless of which page I am in.  After finishing my user research section I notice how the feature prioritization and matrix helped organize what needs to be done next.  These diagrams and excel sheets help establish what features should be added in the future, and which features are more important than the rest.  The challenges I come across during the user research, was figuring out which features can be beneficial, but are still within my capabilities as a web developer.</p>
        <p>During the user testing portion, it helped me visualize how my website will or should be used by multiple different users and how they differ from one another.  The cognitive walkthroughs are especially helpful in gathering feedback on my website, being able to ovserve the user's reaction and response directly.  The user testing add on to the user research by giving me feedback on the current interface and how the improvements can help fix some of the problems.  The user tests give me feedback from a bigger audience, without affecting thes test in any matter.  The main obstacles and challenges I come across during this portion was creating the right test that can give me useful feedback, and asking the valid questions to the users.</p>
        
        <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
        <p>The main problem with my website is the visual cues and better animation that can help improve it techncially and visually which is beneficial to everyone.  To start off, the introduction animation was very mediocre, compare to other website out there.  Currently my animation has quotes coming across the screen before fading, which I thought was fine.  This animation can be improved on, to incorporate things that can be more visually captivating.  The picture album animation also needs some fixing, to slow the the process to give a more appealing affect instead of just animating instantly. One of the biggest change I want to incorporate is to change how navigation works in my website. I used the generic navigation bar, which I decided to change later on after I saw other websites with a more creative approach.</p>
        <p>I also found certain small features that does not change much of the main layout, but can be very useful to the user.  One of the features was one I mention before, was a solution to provide a hyperlink back to the homepage at all times.  Another feature that can be added is changing standard hyperlinks to a better approach, instead of just a line of text with another color.  Each of these features are small, yet can benefit the users greatly by providing a easier way to find hyperlinks, and a simpler way to go back to the main page of the website.  The process of user testing and user reserach helped keep me organized on what needs to be done, and give me useful feedback on the problems in the portfolio.</p>
